					<!-- Welcome to our presentation on the connection between the environment and the economy. -->
					<!-- We'll explore how changes in the environmental factors among other things have impacted item prices over the past decade -->
					<h3 style="color: white;">Introduction</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Environment and economy are intricately linked</li>
						<!-- with each exerting a profound influence on the other -->

						<li class="fragment">Directly affects the prices of essential items</li>
						<!--  we rely on every day such as food, fuel, water, and shelter -->

						<li class="fragment">Environmental factors have the potential to significantly impact the economy</li>
						<!-- and by extension, our daily lives -->

						<li class="fragment">Factors like climate fluctuations, natural disasters, and resource depletion</li>
						<!-- can disrupt the production and distribution of essential items -->
						
						<li class="fragment">Widespread economic consequences</li>
						<!-- affecting industries, jobs, and household budgets -->

						<li class="fragment">Ex. extreme weather events can damage crops, leading to food shortages and increased prices</li>
					</ul>

				<section data-background-image="./assets/raw.png" style="color:aliceblue">
					<!-- To lay the foundation, let's review some key findings from existing research -->
					<h3 style="color: white;">Literature Review</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Numerous studies have highlighted the significant influence of environmental factors on essential item prices</li>
						<!-- with each exerting a profound influence on the other -->

						<!-- <li class="fragment">Studies reveal that rising temperatures can lead to reduced crop yields</li>
						which in turn causes food prices to surge -->

						<li class="fragment">1Â°C increase in temperature can result in a 10-20% decrease in wheat yield <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/81335">[src]</a></li>
						<!-- directly impacting the cost of bread and other wheat-based products -->

						<li class="fragment">Research suggests that regions prone to natural disasters face higher volatility in prices</li>
						<li class="fragment">Studies indicate that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect ecosystems, and promote sustainable resource management can positively influence essential item prices</li>
					</ul>

					<!-- To lay the foundation, let's review some key findings from existing research -->
					<h3 style="color: white;">Environmental Data Collection</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Temperature and precipitation data from historical records and local meteorological agencies for impact of climate change on agriculture and water resources</li>
						<li class="fragment">"Long-term temperature trends are indicative of climate change and can have profound effects on crop yields." (Source: IPCC Fifth Assessment Report)</li>
</ul></section><section><ul>
						<li class="">Soil quality testing from local agricultural agencies for influence on agricultural productivity and food prices</li>
						<li class="fragment">"Soil degradation can reduce crop yields and increase the need for fertilizers, impacting food production." (Source: Food and Agriculture Organization - FAO)</li>

						<li class="fragment">Pollution data from environmental agencies for impact on health, productivity, and healthcare costs</li>
						<li class="fragment">"Air pollution has been linked to respiratory diseases, increasing healthcare costs and reducing labor productivity." (Source: The World Bank)</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./assets/raw.png" style="color:aliceblue">
					<!-- To lay the foundation, let's review some key findings from existing research -->
					<h3 style="color: white;">Economic Data Collection</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Price fluctuations of staple foods from indices, local markets and consumer expenditure surveys for food security, household budgets</li>
						
						<li class="fragment">Data on water tariffs and the availability of clean drinking water from water utilities, government reports for water scarcity and pollution</li>

						<li class="fragment">Fuel prices from Govt. energy departments, fuel retailers as they impact transportation costs</li>
						<li class="fragment">Real estate prices from housing market data and databases for cost of living and the impacts of natural disasters</li>
					</ul>

					<!-- To lay the foundation, let's review some key findings from existing research -->
					<h3 style="color: white;">Data Analysis</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Examining the temperature and precipitation data shows inverse relationship between rising temperatures and crop yields, affecting food prices. This shows the impact of climate change on agriculture and its economic repercussions.</li>
						
						<li class="fragment">There is a direct relationship between soil degradation and the demand for fertilizers, which has consequences for both food production and prices, showing the importance of soil quality in food production and its economic consequences.</li>
					</ul></section><section><ul>
						<li class="">Reviewing pollution data shows association between elevated air pollution levels and increased healthcare expenses, leading to reduced labor productivity. This connection underscores the economic impact of environmental pollution on healthcare costs and workforce efficiency.</li>

						<li class="fragment">The data analysis suggests a direct relationship between rising temperatures and increases in food prices, illustrating the influence of climate change. This correlation highlights how environmental changes directly impact the costs of essential items.</li>
					</ul></section><section><ul>
						<li class="">Analysis of data related to fuel prices shows a positive link with resource depletion and an indirect connection with climate change. This correlation underscores the interplay between the availability of natural resources and the pricing of energy.</li>

						<li class="fragment">The analysis of data indicates a direct association between water scarcity and the price of purified drinking water. This relationship emphasizes the economic consequences of water scarcity and the imperative for sustainable water resource management.</li>
